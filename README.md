Hi! If you're interested, check out my personal webpage to know about me: [zokalyx.github.io](https://zokalyx.github.io/).

When it comes to coding, I'm really interested in:
- Discord bots
- Websites
- Games
- Operating systems

As of writing this, my favorite languages are:
- C
- Python
- Rust
- Zig
- Haskell

Although the one I've used the most is likely JavaScript...
